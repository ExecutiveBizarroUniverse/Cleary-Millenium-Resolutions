## Resolved Clay Millennium Problems

### 1. P vs NP
**Paper:** Final_Clay_Completion_Paper.pdf  
**Summary:** Using geometric execution and prime structure symmetry, RSA-class semiprimes are factored deterministically. In structured space, NP collapses into P.

### 2. Navier–Stokes Existence and Smoothness
**Paper:** Resolution_of_the_Navier_Stokes_Blowup_Problem_via_Quantized_Angular_Execution.pdf  
**Summary:** Fluid blowup is impossible when modeled with recursive angular execution steps. Flow smoothness is enforced by structure, not estimated.

### 3. Hodge Conjecture
**Paper:** Resolution_of_the_Hodge_Conjecture_via_Linear_Execution_and_Interaction_Causality.pdf  
**Summary:** Forms are not abstract—structure emerges from layered execution fields. The conjecture resolves through causal interaction.

### 4. Yang–Mills Mass Gap
**Paper:** Existence of a Mass Gap in a Discrete SU(3) Gauge Theory Via a Quantized Execution Model.pdf  
**Summary:** The mass gap arises naturally from recursive delay in SU(3) execution. No symmetry breaking needed—mass is recursion lag.

### 5. Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer Conjecture
**Paper:** Final_Clay_Completion_Paper.pdf  
**Summary:** Zero behavior follows directly from structured recursion and base-8 lattice transitions. No conjecture—just discrete symmetry.

### 6. Riemann Hypothesis
**Paper:** Resolution_of_the_Riemann_Hypothesis.pdf  
**Summary:** Zeta zero alignment is a structural artifact of recursive prime delay and wave inversion. Fully resolved in causal geometry.

### 7. Riemann Hypothesis (Finite Fields)
**Paper:** Resolution_of_the_Riemann_Hypothesis.pdf  
**Summary:** The finite-field version resolves within the same lattice recursion model. All zero behavior aligns to Planck execution logic.
